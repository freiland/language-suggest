      <h1>Play on drummer, learn <strong>Python.</strong></h1>

      <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.</p>

    <div id="ruby">
      <h1>Hey, you should learn  <strong>Ruby.</strong></h1>

      <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

        Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic, and Lisp.</p>

    <div id="go">
      <h1>Congrats, you should learn <strong>Go</strong>!</h1>

      <p>Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="rust">
      <h1>You should be proud, you're most suited to learn <strong>Rust.</strong></h1>

      <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.</p>
